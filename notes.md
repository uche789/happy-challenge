The main goal of this challenge is to create a mocked UI that allows the user to
select what rates best suits them.

## Business Requirements:
- Once the results page loads, we should see all offers available.
- We should be able to filter by offer type, number of seats, car category and
gear type with ease.
- We want to be able to see each offerâ€™s relevant information (feel free to
choose what is relevant to the end user or not).
- We should be able to reset the used filters.
- We expect to be able to go the next step, the booking form, when we select
a specific offer.
